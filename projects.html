        WACM was a club I founded and ran with the help of a number of amazing people at Western Sydney University.
        I layed the groundwork and aimed for the club to be the representative society for the new School of Computing, Data and Mathematical Sciences.

            <b> 2019 </b> <br><br>
            In my final semester for the unit 301111 Predictive Modelling, I worked on analysing data of patients
            in the emergency department in hospitals and the limited information received in that stage can be used
            to predict the severity of their illness, with a particular focus on Sepsis.

            As a recipient of the Summer Research Scholarship from the Western Sydney University,
            I looked into simulating where telescopes would point on the map of the universe in relation to
            how they were set up here on Earth.
