      <h1> Welcome </h1>
      <p>
        I am originally from Nepal, and arrived in Sydney, Australia in 2017.
        <br><br>
        I currently work as a Data Engineer at KPMG Australia in the Data Platforms team. Prior to that,
        I was a Data Analyst graduate at PwC Australia.
        I hold a degree in computer science from Western Sydney University.

        <br><br>
        Having experienced working across data analytics, data advisory and data engineering, I keen on developing my career
        in the analytics engineering space.
        <p>
        Outside of work I enjoy hiking and camping to new places, going on runs (and hitting the gym nowdays),
        listen to podcasts (current go tos are HubermanLab and Academy of Ideas) and trying out good food.
