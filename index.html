      <h1> Welcome </h1>
      <p>
        I was born and raised in Kathmandu Nepal and came to Sydney, Australia when I was 18. I currently work as a
        consultant at PwC Australia.
        I hold a degree in computer science and am keen on developing my career in the data analytics and software
        engineering space.
        In my spare time I enjoy travelling to new places, listen to podcasts and trying out good food.
