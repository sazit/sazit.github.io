### About

I am a CS student currently studying at Western Sydney University. Currently I am working as a summer research student for the Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute. My project comprises of the analysis of word embeddings such as “word2vec” and “GloVe” and evaluating their utility by examining the racism classification accuracy when using their representation.

My academic interests lie in artificial intelligence, statistics and software engineering.
