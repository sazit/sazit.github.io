        <b> KPMG Australia - Data Engineer</b> <br><br>
        Shifting gears and formally moving into a data engineering role, I am able to learn and tackle the problems I've seen to date
        at its core - on the data quality. Primarily building data platforms on the cloud for existing on-prem systems,
        I have worked across building infrastructure, batch integration pipelines, curation scripts and devops pipelines from scratch.
        Hoping to learn further on cloud and big data technologies.

      the mapping and visualise it.
